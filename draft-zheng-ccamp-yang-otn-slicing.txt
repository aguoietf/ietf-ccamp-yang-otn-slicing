            Framework and Data Model for OTN Network Slicing
                 draft-zheng-ccamp-yang-otn-slicing-02

Abstract

   The requirement of slicing network resource with desired quality of
   service is emerging at every network technology, including the
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN).  As a part of the transport
   network, OTN can provide hard pipes with guaranteed data isolation
   and deterministic low latency, which are highly demanded in the
   Service Level Agreement (SLA).  This document describes a framework
   for OTN network slicing and a YANG data model augmentation of the OTN
   topology model.  Additional YANG data model augmentations will be
   defined in a future version of this draft.

   Service Level Agreement (SLA).  This document describes a framework
   for OTN network slicing and a YANG data model augmentation of the OTN
   topology model.  Additional YANG data model augmentations will be
   defined in a future version of this draft.

2.  Use Cases for OTN Network Slicing

2.1.  Leased Line Services with OTN

   For end business customers (like OTT or enterprises), leased lines
   have the advantage of providing high-speed connections with low
   costs.  On the other hand, the traffic control of leased lines is
   very challenging due to rapid changes in service demands.  Carriers
   are recommended to provide network-level slicing capabilities to meet
   this demand.  Based on such capabilities, private network users have
   full control over the sliced resources which have allocated to them
   and which could be used to support their leased lines, when needed.
   Users may formulate policies based on the demand for services and
   time to schedule the resources from the entire network's perspective
   flexibly.  For example, the bandwidth between any two points may be
   established or released based on the time or monitored traffic
   characteristics.  The routing and bandwidth may be adjusted at a
   specific time interval to maximize network resource utilization
   efficiency.

2.2.  Co-construction and Sharing

   Co-construction and sharing of a network are becoming a popular means
   among service providers to reduce networking building CAPEX.  For Co-
   construction and sharing case, there are typically multiple co-
   founders for the same network.  For example, one founder may provide
   optical fibres and another founder may provide OTN equipment, while
   each occupies a certain percentage of the usage rights of the network
   resources.  In this scenario, the network O&M is performed by a
   certain founder in each region, where the same founder usually
   deploys an independent management and control system.  The other
   founders of the network use each other's management and control
   system to provision services remotely.  In this scenario, different
   founders' network resources need to be automatically (associated)
   divided, isolated, and visualized.  In addition, all founders have
   independent O&M capabilities, and should be able to perform service-
   level provisioning in their respective slices.

2.3.  Wholesale of optical resources

   In the optical resource wholesale market, smaller, local carriers and
   wireless carriers may rent resources from larger carriers, or
   infrastructure carriers instead of building their networks.



Zheng, et al.           Expires October 31, 2021                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      Framework and YANG of OTN Slices          April 2021


   Likewise, international carriers may rent resources from respective
   local carriers and local carriers may lease their owned networks to
   each other to achieve better network utilization efficiency.  From
   the perspective of a resource provider, it is crucial that a network
   slice is timely configured to meet traffic matrix requirements
   requested by its tenants.  The support for multi-tenancy within the
   resource provider's network demands that the network slices are
   qualitatively isolated from each other to meet the requirements for
   transparency, non-interference, and security.  Typically, a resource
   purchaser expects to use the leased network resources flexibly, just
   like they are self-constructed.  Therefore, the purchaser is not only
   provided with a network slice, but also the full set of
   functionalities for operating and maintaining the network slice.  The
   purchaser also expects to, in a flexible and independent manner,
   schedule and maintain physical resources to support their own end-to-
   end automation using both leased and self-constructed network
   resources.

2.4.  Vertical dedicated network with OTN

   Vertical industry slicing is an emerging category of network slicing
   due to the high demand for private high-speed network interconnects
   for industrial applications.  In this scenario, the biggest challenge
   is to implement differentiated optical network slices based on the
   requirements from different industries.  For example, in the
   financial industry, to support high-frequency transactions, the slice
   must ensure to provide the minimum latency along with the mechanism
   for latency management.  For the healthcare industry, online
   diagnosis network and software capabilities to ensure the delivery of
   HD video without frame loss.  For bulk data migration in data
   centers, the network needs to support on-demand, large-bandwidth
   allocation.  In each of the aforementioned vertical industry
   scenarios, the bandwidth shall be adjusted as required to ensure
   flexible and efficient network resource usage.

2.5.  End-to-end network slicing

   An end-to-end network slice, such as a 5G network slice
   [TS.28.530-3GPP] may span multiple technological and administrative
   domains.  According to [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition],
   IETF network slice provides the required connectivity between
   different entities of an end-to-end network slice, with a specific
   commitment.  An IETF network slice may be composed of network slices
   from underlying network domains that include OTN, in a combination of
   hierarchical (recursive) or sequential (stitched) manner.  In this
   case, an OTN network slice is essentially a realization of an IETF
   network slice in OTN network domains.

3.  Framework for OTN slicing

   An OTN slice is a collection of OTN network resources that are used
   to establish a logically dedicated OTN virtual network over one or
   more OTN networks.  For example, the bandwidth of an OTN slice is
   described in terms of a total number or a specific set of OTN
   tributary slots ; the labels may be specified as OTN tributary slots
   and/or tributary ports to allow slice users to interconnect devices
   with matching specifications.

   The relationship between an OTN slice and an IETF network slice
   [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-definition] is for further
   discussions.

   To support the configuration of OTN slices, an OTN slice controller
   (OTN-SC) can be deployed either outside or within the SDN controller.
   In the former case, the OTN-SC translates an OTN slice configuration
   request into a TE topology configuration or a set of TE tunnel
   configurations, and instantiate it by using the TE topology [RFC8795]
   or TE tunnel [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] interfaces at the MPI (MDSC-to-
   PNC Interface), as defined in the ACTN framework [RFC8453].  In the
   latter case, an Orchestrator or an end-to-end slice controller may
   request OTN slices directly through the OTN slicing interface
   provided by the OTN-SC.  A higher-level OTN-SC may also designate the
   creation of OTN slices to a lower-level OTN-SC in a recursive manner.
   Figure 1 illustrates the OTN slicing control hierarchy and the
   positioning of the OTN slicing interfaces.

              Figure 1: Positioning of OTN Slicing Interfaces

   A particular OTN network resource, such as a port or link, may be
   sliced in two modes:

   o  Link-based slicing, where a link and its associated link
      termination points (LTPs) are dedicatedly allocated to a
      particular OTN network slice.

   o  Tributary-slot based slicing, where multiple OTN network slices
      share the same link by allocating different OTN tributary slots in
      different granularities.

Internet-Draft      Framework and YANG of OTN Slices          April 2021


   Additionally, since an OTN switch is typically designed to be fully
   non-blocking switchable at the lowest ODU container granularity, , it
   is desirable to specify just the total number of tributary slots in
   the lowest granularity (e.g.  ODU0) when configuring tributary-slot
   based slicing on links and ports internal to an OTN network.  In
   multi-domain OTN network scenarios where separate OTN network slices
   are created on each of the OTN networks and are stitched at inter-
   domain OTN links, it is necessary to specify matching tributary slots
   at the endpoints of the inter-domain links.  In some real network
   scenarios, OTN network resources including tributary slots are
   managed explicitly by network operators for network maintenance
   considerations.  Therefore an OTN slice controller shall support
   configuring an OTN slice with both options.

4.  YANG Data Model for OTN Slicing Configuration

4.1.  OTN Slicing YANG Model for MPI

4.1.1.  MPI YANG Model Overview

   An SDN controller (PNC or MDSC) exposes to the OTN-SC set of
   available resources for OTN slicing in the form of an abstract TE
   topology.  When the OTN-SC receives slice configuration from the NBI,
   it translates the configuration into a colored graph on the abstract
   TE topology, by marking corresponding link resources on the TE
   topology received from the SDN controller with a slice identifier and
   OTN-specific resource requirements, e.g. the number of ODU time
   slots.  When the SDN controller receives the slice configuration, it
   shall create a new virtual TE link for each of the colored links to
   hold the reserved OTN time slots for time slot-based slicing.  These
   resultant virtual links are then included in the TE topology
   advertisement to the OTN-SC.

   TBD.

5.  Manageability Considerations

   To ensure the security and controllability of physical resource
   isolation, slice-based independent operation and management are
   required to achieve management isolation.  Each optical slice
   typically requires dedicated accounts, permissions, and resources for
   independent access and O&M.  This mechanism is to guarantee the
   information isolation among slice tenants and to avoid resource
   conflicts.  The access to slice management functions will only be
   permitted after successful security checks.

6.  Security Considerations

   <Add any security considerations>

7.  IANA Considerations
