### IANA review feedback
~~~
Dear Authors,

Before the IETF meeting, we check working group agendas for documents with IANA-related issues. We have a note about the current version of this document:

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ccamp-yang-otn-slicing

It looks like this might be missing an XML registration for ietf-otn-slice-mpI.

If you have any questions, just let us know. If you'd like to talk in person, you can find us next to the RFC Editor's table from Monday through Thursday. You can also request another review at any time by contacting us at iana@iana.org.

Best regards,

Amanda Baber
IANA Operations Manager
