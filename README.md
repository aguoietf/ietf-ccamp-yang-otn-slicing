# Abstract

   The requirement of slicing network resource with desired quality of
   service is emerging at every network technology, including the
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN). As a part of the transport network,
   OTN can provide hard pipes with guaranteed data isolation and
   deterministic low latency, which are highly demanded in the Service
   Level Agreement (SLA).

   This document describes a framework for OTN network slicing and a
   YANG data model augmentation of the OTN topology model. Additional
   YANG data model augmentations will be defined in a future version of
   this draft.
