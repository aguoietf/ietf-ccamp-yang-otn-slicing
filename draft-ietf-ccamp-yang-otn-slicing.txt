Abstract

   The requirement of slicing network resources with desired quality of
   service is emerging at every network technology, including the
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN).  As a part of the transport
   network, OTN can provide hard pipes with guaranteed data isolation
   and deterministic low latency, which are highly demanded in the
   Service Level Agreement (SLA).

   This document describes a framework for OTN network slicing and
   defines YANG data models with OTN technology-specific augments
   deployed at both the north and south bound of the OTN network slice
   controller.  Additional YANG data model augmentations will be defined
   in a future version of this draft.

1.  Introduction

   The requirement of slicing network resources with desired quality of
   service is emerging at every network technology, including the
   Optical Transport Networks (OTN).  As a part of the transport
   network, OTN can provide hard pipes with guaranteed data isolation
   and deterministic low latency, which are highly demanded in the
   Service Level Agreement (SLA).  This document describes a framework
   for OTN network slicing and defines YANG data models with OTN
   technology-specific augments deployed at both the north and south
   bound of the OTN network slice controller.  Additional YANG data
   model augmentations will be defined in a future version of this
   draft.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all

1.3.  Definition of OTN Slice

   An OTN slice is an OTN virtual network topology connecting a number
   of OTN endpoints using a set of shared or dedicated OTN network
   resources to satisfy specific service level objectives (SLOs).

   An OTN slice is a technology-specific realization of the RFC 9543
   network slice service [RFC9543] in the OTN domain, with the
   capability of configuring slice resources in the term of OTN
   technologies.  Therefore, all the terms and definitions concerning
   network slicing as defined in [RFC9543] apply to OTN slicing.

   An OTN slice can span multiple OTN administrative domains,
   encompassing access links, intra-domain paths, and inter-domain
   links.  An OTN slice may include multiple endpoints, each associated
   with a set of physical or logical resources, e.g. optical port or
   time slots, at the termination point (TP) of an access link or inter-
   domain link at an OTN provider edge (PE) equipment.

   An end-to-end OTN slice may be composed of multiple OTN segment
   slices in a hierarchical or sequential (or stitched) combination.

   Figure 1 illustrates the scope of OTN slices in multi-domain
   environment.

   OTN slices may be pre-configured by the management plane and
   presented to the customer via the northbound interface (NBI), or be
   dynamically provisioned by a higher layer slice controller, e.g., an
   RFC 9543 network slice controller (NSC) through the NBI.  The OTN
   slice is provided by a service provider to a customer to be used as
   though it was part of the customer's own networks.

2.1.  Leased Line Services with OTN

   For end business customers (like OTT or enterprises), leased lines
   have the advantage of providing high-speed connections with low
   costs.  On the other hand, the traffic control of leased lines is
   very challenging due to rapid changes in service demands.  Carriers
   are recommended to provide network-level slicing capabilities to meet
   this demand.  Based on such capabilities, private network users have
   full control over the sliced resources which have been allocated to
   them and which could be used to support their leased lines, when
   needed.  Users may formulate policies based on the demand for
   services and time to schedule the resources from the entire network's
   perspective flexibly.  For example, the bandwidth between any two
   points may be established or released based on the time or monitored
   traffic characteristics.  The routing and bandwidth may be adjusted
   at a specific time interval to maximize network resource utilization
   efficiency.

2.2.  Co-construction and Sharing

   Co-construction and sharing of a network are becoming a popular means
   among service providers to reduce networking building CAPEX.  For Co-
   construction and sharing case, there are typically multiple co-
   founders for the same network.  For example, one founder may provide
   optical fibres and another founder may provide OTN equipment, while
   each occupies a certain percentage of the usage rights of the network
   resources.  In this scenario, the network O&M is performed by a
   certain founder in each region, where the same founder usually
   deploys an independent management and control system.  The other
   founders of the network use each other's management and control
   system to provision services remotely.  In this scenario, different
   founders' network resources need to be automatically (associated)
   divided, isolated, and visualized.  All founders may share or have
   independent O&M capabilities, and should be able to perform service-
   level provisioning in their respective slices.

2.3.  Wholesale of optical resources

   In the optical resource wholesale market, smaller, local carriers and
   wireless carriers may rent resources from larger carriers, or
   infrastructure carriers instead of building their networks.
   Likewise, international carriers may rent resources from respective
   local carriers and local carriers may lease their owned networks to
   each other to achieve better network utilization efficiency.  From
   the perspective of a resource provider, it is crucial that a network
   slice is timely configured to meet traffic matrix requirements
   requested by its tenants.  The support for multi-tenancy within the
   resource provider's network demands that the network slices are

   qualitatively isolated from each other to meet the requirements for
   transparency, non-interference, and security.  Typically, a resource
   purchaser expects to use the leased network resources flexibly, just
   like they are self-constructed.  Therefore, the purchaser is not only
   provided with a network slice, but also the full set of
   functionalities for operating and maintaining the network slice.  The
   purchaser also expects to, flexibly and independently, schedule and
   maintain physical resources to support their own end-to-end
   automation using both leased and self-constructed network resources.

2.4.  Vertical dedicated network with OTN

   Vertical industry slicing is an emerging category of network slicing
   due to the high demand for private high-speed network interconnects
   for industrial applications.  In this scenario, the biggest challenge
   is to implement differentiated optical network slices based on the
   requirements from different industries.  For example, in the
   financial industry, to support high-frequency transactions, the slice
   must ensure to provide the minimum latency along with the mechanism
   for latency management.  For the healthcare industry, online
   diagnosis network and software capabilities to ensure the delivery of
   HD video without frame loss.  For bulk data migration in data
   centers, the network needs to support on-demand, large-bandwidth
   allocation.  In each of the aforementioned vertical industry
   scenarios, the bandwidth shall be adjusted as required to ensure
   flexible and efficient network resource usage.

2.5.  End-to-end network slicing

   In an end-to-end network slicing scenario such as 5G network slicing
   [TS.28.530-3GPP], an RFC 9543 network slice [RFC9543] provides the
   required connectivity between other different segments of an end-to-
   end network slice, such as the Radio Access Network (RAN) and the
   Core Network (CN) segments, with a specific performance commitment.
   An RFC 9543 network slice could be composed of network slices from
   multiple technological and administrative domains.  An RFC 9543
   network slice can be realized by using or combining multiple
   underlying OTN slices with OTN resources, e.g., ODU time slots or ODU
   containers, to achieve end-to-end slicing across the transport
   domain.

3.  Framework for OTN slicing

   OTN slices may be abstracted differently depending on the requirement
   contained in the configuration provided by the slice customer.
   Whereas the customer requests an OTN slice to provide connectivity
   between specified endpoints, an OTN slice can be abstracted as a set
   of endpoint-to-endpoint links, with each link formed by an end-to-end
   tunnel across the underlying OTN networks.  The resources associated
   with each link of the slice is reserved and commissioned in the
   underlying physical network upon the completion of configuring the
   OTN slice and all the links are active.

   An OTN slice can also be abstracted as an abstract topology when the
   customer requests the slice to share resources between multiple
   endpoints and to use the resources on demand.  The abstract topology
   may consist of virtual nodes and virtual links, and their associated
   resources are reserved but not commissioned across the underlying OTN
   networks.  The customer can later commission resources within the
   slice dynamically using the NBI provided by the service provider.  An
   OTN slice could use abstract topology to connect endpoints with
   shared resources to optimize the resource utilization, and
   connections can be activated within the slice as needed.

   It is worth noting that those means to abstract an OTN slice are
   similar to the Virtual Network (VN) abstraction defined for higher-
   level interfaces in [RFC8453], in which context a connectivity-based
   slice corresponds to Type 1 VN and a resource-based slice corresponds
   to Type 2 VN, respectively.

   A particular resource in an OTN network, such as a port or link, may
   be sliced with one of the two granularity levels:

   *  Link-based slicing, in which a link and its associated link
      termination points (LTPs) are dedicatedly allocated to a
      particular OTN slice.

   *  Tributary-slot based slicing, in which multiple OTN slices share
      the same link by allocating different OTN tributary slots in
      different granularities.

   Furthermore, an OTN switch is typically fully non-blocking switching
   at the lowest ODU container granularity, it is desirable to specify
   just the total number of ODU containers in the lowest granularity
   (e.g.  ODU0), when configuring tributary-slot based slicing on links
   and ports internal to an OTN network.  In multi-domain OTN network
   scenarios where separate OTN slices are created on each of the OTN
   networks and are stitched at inter-domain OTN links, it is necessary
   to specify matching tributary slots at the endpoints of the inter-

   domain links.  In some real network scenarios, OTN network resources
   including tributary slots are managed explicitly by network operators
   for network maintenance considerations.  Therefore, an OTN slice
   controller shall support configuring an OTN slice with both options.

   An OTN slice controller (OTN-SC) is a logical function responsible
   for the life-cycle management of OTN slices instantiated within the
   corresponding OTN network domains.  The OTN-SC provides technology-
   specific interfaces at its northbound (OTN-SC NBI) to allow a higher-
   layer slice controller, such as an RFC 9543 network slice controller
   (NSC) or an orchestrator, to request OTN slices with OTN-specific
   requirements.  The OTN-SC interfaces at the southbound using the
   MDSC-to-PNC interface (MPI) with a Physical Network Controller (PNC)
   or Multi-Domain Service Orchestrator (MDSC), as defined in the ACTN
   control framework [RFC8453].  The logical function within the OTN-SC
   is responsible for translating the OTN slice requests into concrete
   slice realization which can be understood and provisioned at the
   southbound by the PNC or MDSC.

   The presence of OTN-SC provides multiple options for a high-level
   slice controller or an orchestrator to configure and realize slicing
   in OTN networks, depending on whether a customer's slice request is
   technology agnostic or technology specific:

   Option 1[opt.1]: An IETF NSC receives a technology-agnostic slice
   request from the IETF NSC NBI and realizes full or part of the slice
   in OTN networks directly through MPI provided by the PNC or MDSC.
   The IETF NSC is responsible for mapping a technology-agnostic slicing
   request into an OTN technology-specific realization.  In this option,
   the OTN-SC is not used.

   Option 2[opt.2]: An IETF NSC receives a technology-agnostic slice
   request from the IETF NSC NBI and delegates the request to the OTN-SC
   through the OTN-SC NBI, which is OTN technology specific.  The OTN-SC
   in turn realizes the slice in single or multi domain OTN networks by
   working with the underlying PNC or MDSC.  In this option, the OTN-SC
   is considered as a realization of IETF NSC, i.e., an NS realizer as
   per [I-D.draft-contreras-teas-slice-controller-models], when the
   underlying network is OTN.  The OTN-SC is also a subordinate slice
   controller of the RFC 9543 NSC, which is consistent with the
   hierarchical control of slices specified by [RFC9543].

   Option 3[opt.3]: An OTN-aware orchestrator may request an OTN
   technology-specific slice with OTN-specific SLOs through the OTN-SC
   NBI to the OTN-SC.  The OTN-SC in turn realizes the slice in single
   or multi domain OTN networks by working with the underlying PNC or
   MDSC

   An OTN slice may be realized by using standard MPI interfaces,
   control plane, network management system (NMS) or any other
   proprietary interfaces as needed.  Examples of such interfaces
   include the abstract TE topology [RFC8795], TE tunnel
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te],L1VPN[RFC4847], or Netconf/YANG based
   interfaces such as OpenConfig.  Some of these interfaces, such as the
   TE tunnel model, are suitable for creating connectivity-based OTN
   slices which represent a slice as a set of TE tunnels, while other
   interfaces such as the TE topology model are more suitable for
   creating resource-based OTN slices which represent a slice as a
   topology.

   The OTN-SC NBI is a technology-specific interface that augments the
   IETF NSC NBI, which is technology- agnostic.

   Figure 2 illustrates the OTN slicing control hierarchy , the
   positioning of the OTN slicing interfaces as well as the options for
   OTN slice configuration.

   OTN-SC functionalities may be recursive such that a higher-level OTN-
   SC may designate the creation of OTN slices to a lower-level OTN-SC
   in a recursive manner.  This scenario may apply to the creation of
   OTN slices in multi-domain OTN networks, where multiple domain-wide
   OTN slices provisioned by lower-layer OTN-SCs are stitched to support
   a multi-domain OTN slice provisioned by the higher-level OTN-SC.
   Alternatively, the OTN-SC may interface with an MDSC, which in turn
   interfaces with multiple PNCs through the MPI to realize OTN slices
   in multi-domain OTN networks without OTN-SC recursion.  Figure 3
   illustrates both options for OTN slicing in multi-domain.

                     Figure 3: OTN-SC for multi-domain

   OTN-SC functionalities are logically independent and may be deployed
   in different combinations to cater to the realization needs.  In
   reference to the ACTN control framework [RFC8453], an OTN-SC may be
   deployed

   *  as an independent network function;

   *  together with a Physical Network Controller (PNC) for single-
      domain or with a Multi-Domain Service Orchestrator (MDSC)for
      multi-domain;

   *  together with a higher-level network slice controller to support
      end-to-end network slicing;

4.  Realizing OTN Slices

   [RFC9543] introduces a mechanism for an RFC 9543 network slice
   controller to realize network slices by constructing Network Resource
   Partitions (NRP).  A NRP is a collection of resources identified in
   the underlay network to facilitate the mapping of network slices onto
   available network resources.  An NRP is a scope view of a topology
   and may be considered as a topology in its own right.  Thus, in

Internet-Draft      Framework and YANG of OTN Slices           June 2024


   traffic-engineered (TE) networks including OTN, an NRP may be simply
   represented as an abstract TE topology defined by [RFC8795].  For OTN
   networks, An NRP may be represented as an abstract OTN topology
   defined by [I-D.ietf-ccamp-otn-topo-yang].

   The NRP may be used to address the scalability issues where there may
   be considerable numbers of control and data plane states required to
   be stored and programmed if network slices are mapped directly to the
   underlay topology.  NRP is internal to a network slice controller,
   and use of NRPs is optional yet could benefit a network slice
   realization in large-scale networks, including OTN networks.

   For connectivity-based OTN slices, a connection within an OTN slice
   is typically realized by an OTN tunnel in the underlay topology and
   resources are reserved by the tunnel, thus use of NRP is optional in
   this case.

   For resource-based OTN slices, the OTN-SC may map an OTN slice
   directly onto the underlay TE topology presented by the subtended
   network controller (MDSC or PNC) without creating NRP topologies.
   Due to the need for reserving resources, the OTN-SC needs to color
   corresponding link resources of the underlay topology with a slice
   identifier and maintain the coloring to keep track of the mapping of
   OTN slices.  The OTN-SC may push the colored topology to the
   subtended MDSC or PNC using the MPI model defined in this draft.

   Alternatively, an OTN slice may be mapped to a NRP as an overlay
   abstract OTN TE topology on top of the underlay topology.  The
   corresponding link resources allocated to the slice is encapsulated
   in and tracked by the abstract topology, and a given link or port in
   the NRP topology represents resources that are reserved in the
   underlay topology.  Multiple OTN slices may be mapped to the same
   NRP, and a single connectivity construct of the slice may be mapped
   to only one NRP, as per [RFC9543].  The resources of an NRP topology
   are reserved and shared by all the OTN slices mapped to this NRP, and
   the NRP topology may be pushed directly to the subtended MDSC or PNC,
   thus eliminating the need for link coloring if using the underlay
   topology.

   Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between OTN slices and NRP.

5.  YANG Data Model for OTN Slicing Configuration

5.1.  OTN Slicing YANG Model for MPI

5.1.1.  MPI YANG Model Overview

   For the configuration of connectivity-based OTN slices, existing
   models such as the TE tunnel interface [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] may be
   used and no addition is needed.  This model is addressing the case
   for configuring resource-based OTN slices, where the model permits to
   reserve resources exploiting the common knowledge of an underlying
   virtual topology between the OTN-SC and the subtended network
   controller (MDSC or PNC).  The slice is configured by marking
   corresponding link resources on the TE topology received from the
   underlying MDSC or PNC with a slice identifier and OTN-specific
   resource requirements, e.g. the number of ODU time slots or the type/
   number of ODU containers.  The MDSC or PNC, based on the marked
   resources by the OTN-SC, will update the underlying TE topology with
   new TE link for each of the colored links to keep booked the reserved
   OTN resources e.g. time slots or ODU containers.

5.2.  OTN Slicing YANG Model for OTN-SC NBI

5.2.1.  NBI YANG Model Overview

   The YANG model for OTN-SC NBI is OTN-technology specific, but shares
   many common constructs and attributes with the common network slicing
   YANG model defined in [I-D.ietf-teas-ietf-network-slice-nbi-yang].
   Furthermore, the OTN-SC NBI YANG is expected to support both
   connectivity-based and resource-based slice configuration, which is
   likely a common requirement for supporting slicing at other transport
   network layers, e.g.  WDM or MPLS(-TP).

   The OTN slicing model augments the common network slicing YANG model
   by extending OTN technology-specific SLO and SLE attributes which can
   be requested by OTN-aware customers and allows the customer to
   specify desired OTN signal quality.  These attributes include:

   *  The performance objective for Optical Data Unit (ODU) containers
      as defined in ITU-T-G.8201-Amd.1.

   *  Bandwidth specification in the type and number of ODU containers.

              Figure 8: YANG model for transport network slice

6.  Manageability Considerations

   To ensure the security and controllability of physical resource
   isolation, slice-based independent operation and management are
   required to achieve management isolation.  Each optical slice
   typically requires dedicated accounts, permissions, and resources for
   independent access and O&M.  This mechanism is to guarantee the
   information isolation among slice tenants and to avoid resource
   conflicts.  The access to slice management functions will only be
   permitted after successful security checks.

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

Internet-Draft      Framework and YANG of OTN Slices           June 2024


   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  Considerations in Section 8 of
   [RFC8795] are also applicable to their subtrees in the module defined
   in this document.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  Considerations in Section 8 of
   [RFC8795] are also applicable to their subtrees in the module defined
   in this document.

8.  IANA Considerations

   It is proposed to IANA to assign new URIs from the "IETF XML
   Registry" [RFC3688] as follows:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-otn-slice
      Registrant Contact: The IESG
      XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-otn-slice-mpi
      Registrant Contact: The IESG
      XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers two YANG modules in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].

      name: ietf-otn-slice
      namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-otn-slice
      prefix: otns
      reference: RFC XXXX

      name: ietf-otn-slice-mpi
      namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-otn-slice-mpi
      prefix: otns-mpi
      reference: RFC XXXX
